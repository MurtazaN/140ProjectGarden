Assignment: Programming - Project 1
Name: Murtaza Nipplewala

I finished this code by myself without consulting anyone or any websites.
I did refer to prof. mahadev's notes just to check if everything is correct.
I did run into some hickups but they were relating to math not the code.
For extra credit code I used math rounder which i got from stackoverflow website.

What I learned:  

taking multiple user inputs, declaring, initializing and casting variables with data types, Math.PI and Math.round.
